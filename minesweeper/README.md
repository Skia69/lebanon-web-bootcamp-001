# Minesweeper: Number of Neighbouring Mines
 
Create a function that takes an array representation of a Minesweeper board, and returns another board where the value of each cell is the amount of its neighbouring mines.

### Notes:

* Since in the output the numbers 0-8 are used to determine the amount of adjacent mines, the number 9 will be used to identify the mines instead.
* Here's a [wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minesweeper_(video_game)) explaining how Minesweeper works. You can even [try it here](https://adlogi.github.io/minesweeper/) (but don't spend too much time playing ðŸ˜‰).
* If you get stuck on a challenge please search it online and try to find resources.
* If you are really stuck, please ask your Instructors.


*Example:*

```javascript
// input
[
  [0, 1, 0, 0],
  [0, 0, 1, 0],
  [0, 1, 0, 1],
  [1, 1, 0, 0],
]
```

The `0` represents an empty space . The `1` represents a mine.

You will have to replace each mine with a `9` and each empty space with the number of adjacent mines, the output will look like this:

```javascript
// output
[
  [1, 9, 2, 1],
  [2, 3, 9, 2],
  [3, 9, 4, 9],
  [9, 9, 3, 1],
]
```
